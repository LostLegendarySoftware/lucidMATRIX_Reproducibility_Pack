## Rate Limits

Lucid Matrix implements the following rate limits to prevent abuse:

### Default Rate Limits

| API Endpoint | Time Window | Request Limit | Burst Allowance |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Text Generation | 1 minute | 60 requests | 10 additional requests |
| Reasoning | 1 minute | 30 requests | 5 additional requests |
| Content Analysis | 1 minute | 120 requests | 20 additional requests |
| Batch Processing | 1 hour | 1000 requests | 100 additional requests |

### Rate Limit Implementation

- **Graduated Response**: Warning → Temporary throttling → Temporary block → Extended block
- **Account-Based**: Limits tied to API keys or user accounts
- **IP-Based**: Secondary limits based on source IP address
- **Content-Based**: Dynamic limits based on content sensitivity
- **Adaptive**: Limits adjust based on system load and abuse patterns

### Rate Limit Exceptions

- **Emergency Services**: Verified emergency service providers exempt from limits
- **Research Access**: Approved research institutions with higher limits
- **Enterprise Customers**: Customized limits based on legitimate use cases
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Essential services with dedicated capacity

## Circuit-Breakers

Lucid Matrix implements circuit-breakers to automatically detect and respond to potential abuse or system issues:

### Content-Based Circuit-Breakers

| Trigger | Detection Method | Response | Reset Condition |
|---------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Repeated Harmful Content | Pattern recognition across requests | Block account, log incident | Manual review |
| Policy Circumvention Attempts | Similarity analysis, intent detection | Temporary suspension, warning | 24-hour timeout + review |
| Jailbreak Attempts | Prompt pattern matching, response analysis | Block request, flag account | Manual review |
| Coordinated Abuse | Cross-account pattern analysis | Block related accounts | Manual review |
| Content Policy Violations | Classification, threshold tracking | Progressive restrictions | Graduated timeout |

### System-Based Circuit-Breakers

| Trigger | Detection Method | Response | Reset Condition |
|---------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unusual Traffic Patterns | Statistical anomaly detection | Temporary throttling | Return to normal patterns |
| Resource Exhaustion | System metrics monitoring | Service degradation, prioritization | Resource availability |
| Security Breach Attempts | Security monitoring | Block source, enhance monitoring | Manual review |
| Data Exfiltration Attempts | Traffic pattern analysis | Block access, investigate | Manual review |
| API Abuse | Usage pattern analysis | Restrict access, require verification | Verification completion |

### Circuit-Breaker Implementation

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all system interactions
- **Graduated Response**: Severity of response matches severity of trigger
- **False Positive Mitigation**: Multi-factor verification before severe actions
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about triggered circuit-breakers
