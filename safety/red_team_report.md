# Independent Red Team Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the findings from an independent red team assessment of the Lucid Matrix system conducted between May 15, 2025, and June 30, 2025. The assessment focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms, content policies, and sandbox isolation.

The red team identified **17 findings** across various risk categories, with **2 critical**, **5 high**, **7 medium**, and **3 low** severity issues. All critical and high severity issues have been addressed prior to release, with medium and low severity issues scheduled for remediation in the short term.
