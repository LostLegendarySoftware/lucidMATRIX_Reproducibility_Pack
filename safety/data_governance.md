# Data Governance Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the data governance policies for the Lucid Matrix system, including data retention, privacy controls, compliance with regulations, and content takedown procedures.

## Data Retention

### Default Policy: Zero Retention

By default, Lucid Matrix operates with a **zero data retention** policy:

- No user inputs are stored beyond the duration of the session
- No conversation history is maintained between sessions
- No user data is used for model training or improvement
- All temporary data is deleted upon session completion

### Configurable Retention

Users may explicitly opt into data retention for specific purposes:

| Retention Level | Description | Duration | User Control |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| None (Default) | No data retained | 0 days | Default setting |
| Session Only | Data retained for current session only | Session duration | User can clear at any time |
| Short-Term | Data retained for continuity of experience | 30 days | User can delete individual items or all data |
| Long-Term | Data retained for personalization | 1 year | User can export, delete, or manage data |

### Technical Implementation

- Data retention settings are stored locally by default
- All retained data is encrypted at rest
- Clear visual indicators show current retention status
- One-click data deletion available at all times
- Automatic deletion occurs when retention period expires

## Privacy Controls

### Local Deployment

Lucid Matrix supports fully local deployment:

- All processing occurs on the user's device
- No data leaves the user's system
- No network connectivity required
- Complete isolation from external systems

### Configurable Telemetry

Telemetry is opt-in only and configurable at multiple levels:

| Telemetry Level | Description | Data Collected |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| None (Default) | No telemetry data collected | None |
| Basic | Anonymous usage statistics | Feature usage counts, error rates |
| Enhanced | Performance metrics | Response times, resource usage |
| Full | Detailed diagnostics | System logs, performance traces |

### Data Minimization

All operations follow data minimization principles:

- Only necessary data is processed for each operation
- Data is anonymized whenever possible
- Aggregation is preferred over individual data points
- Explicit purpose limitation for all data processing

## GDPR Compliance

### Data Subject Rights

Lucid Matrix supports all GDPR data subject rights:

- **Right to Access**: Users can export all their data

- **Right to Restriction**: Users can pause data processing
- **Right to Portability**: Data export in standard formats
- **Right to Object**: Users can opt out of specific processing

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

A comprehensive DPIA has been conducted covering:

1. Systematic description of processing operations
2. Assessment of necessity and proportionality
3. Assessment of risks to data subjects
4. Measures to address risks

The DPIA is reviewed and updated annually or when significant changes occur.

### Records of Processing Activities

Detailed records are maintained for all processing activities:

- Purpose of processing
- Categories of data subjects and personal data
- Categories of recipients
- Transfers to third countries (if applicable)
- Time limits for erasure
- Technical and organizational security measures
