# Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the incident response procedures for the Lucid Matrix system, including reporting mechanisms, triage processes, response timelines, and remediation protocols.

## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on severity and impact:

| Severity Level | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Severe impact on safety, security, or operations | Data breach, safety bypass, system compromise | Immediate (< 1 hour) |
| **High** | Significant impact on functionality or trust | Harmful outputs at scale, partial outage, targeted attack | < 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact on specific features or users | Isolated harmful outputs, performance degradation | < 24 hours |
| **Low** | Minor impact with limited scope | Edge case failures, minor bugs, isolated errors | < 72 hours |

## Reporting Mechanisms

### External Reporting

Users and third parties can report incidents through multiple channels:

- **Web Form**: https://lucidmatrix.org/report-incident
- **Email**: incidents@lucidmatrix.org
- **API Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/report-incident
- **In-App Reporting**: "Report Issue" button in all interfaces
- **Emergency Hotline**: +1-555-123-4567 (24/7 for critical incidents)

### Internal Reporting

Team members can report incidents through:

- **Incident Management System**: Internal ticketing system
- **Security Hotline**: Internal emergency number
- **Slack Channel**: #incident-response
- **Email**: internal-incidents@lucidmatrix.org
- **Automated Alerts**: System-generated alerts from monitoring

## Triage Process

### Initial Assessment

1. **Receipt and Acknowledgment**:
   - Automatic acknowledgment sent to reporter
   - Incident logged in incident management system
   - Initial severity assessment based on report details

2. **Severity Classification**:
   - Impact assessment (users affected, functionality impact)
   - Safety implications evaluation
   - Security risk assessment
   - Reputational risk assessment

3. **Response Team Assembly**:
   - Incident coordinator assigned
   - Subject matter experts identified
   - Stakeholders notified based on severity

### 72-Hour Triage Protocol

For all reported incidents, the following timeline is observed:

| Timeframe | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| **First 4 Hours** | - Initial assessment completed<br>- Severity classified<br>- Response team assembled<br>- Initial containment measures implemented |
| **4-24 Hours** | - Detailed investigation initiated<br>- Preliminary root cause analysis<br>- Interim mitigations deployed<br>- Communication plan activated |
| **24-72 Hours** | - Comprehensive investigation completed<br>- Root cause confirmed<br>- Permanent fix developed<br>- Remediation plan finalized |

## Response Procedures

### Critical Incidents

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Activate incident response team
   - Implement emergency containment measures
   - Notify executive leadership
   - Establish incident command center

2. **Communication**:
   - Initial notification to affected users
   - Status page updated
   - Internal stakeholders briefed
   - Regulatory notifications if required

3. **Containment and Mitigation**:
   - Emergency patches deployed
   - System isolation if necessary
   - Traffic filtering or throttling
   - Feature disablement if required

4. **Resolution**:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Comprehensive fix development
   - Testing and validation
   - Phased deployment of fix

### High/Medium/Low Incidents

Scaled response procedures based on severity, following the same general structure with adjusted timelines and resource allocation.

## Hotfix Protocol

For incidents requiring immediate code or model changes:

1. **Hotfix Development**:
   - Rapid development of minimal necessary changes
   - Focused scope to address specific issue
   - Expedited code review process
   - Documentation of emergency changes

2. **Testing**:
   - Accelerated testing focused on fix and regression
   - Safety-critical verification
   - Performance impact assessment
   - Compatibility verification

3. **Deployment**:
   - Canary deployment to subset of users
   - Monitoring for unexpected effects
   - Phased rollout based on monitoring results
   - Rollback capability maintained throughout

4. **Validation**:
   - Post-deployment verification
   - Regression testing
   - User impact assessment
   - Incident recreation attempt to verify fix

## Documentation and Learning

### Incident Documentation

All incidents are documented with:

- Incident timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Actions taken
- Resolution details
- Impact assessment
- Lessons learned
- Preventive measures

### Post-Incident Review

A formal post-incident review is conducted for all critical and high-severity incidents:

1. **Review Meeting**:
   - Facilitated by someone not directly involved
   - All response team members participate
   - Focus on process improvement, not blame
   - Documentation of findings and recommendations

2. **Analysis Areas**:
   - Detection effectiveness
   - Response timeliness
   - Communication effectiveness
   - Technical response adequacy
   - Process adherence
   - Tool effectiveness

3. **Improvement Actions**:
   - Specific, actionable improvements
   - Assigned owners and deadlines
   - Follow-up mechanism
   - Integration into development roadmap
