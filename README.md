lucidMATRIX Reproducibility Pack

by Lost Legendary Labs — Jason “Mesiah Bishop” Langhorne

Overview

The lucidMATRIX Reproducibility Pack provides all artifacts, scripts, and documentation required to independently verify the experimental results reported by Lost Legendary Labs, an independent research group focused on reasoning safety, alignment, and high-performance multimodal inference.

This package enables replication of three core evaluations:

TruthfulQA — factual accuracy and epistemic calibration

EmoBench — emotional intelligence and safety alignment

Latency — interactive response-time performance on mid-range GPUs

All runs are deterministic with seed = 42, and cryptographic signatures are included for audit-level reproducibility.

Benchmark Instructions
TruthfulQA (Truthfulness Benchmark)

Measures factual accuracy and epistemic grounding.
Dataset: 817 questions / 38 categories.

cd artifacts/runs/truthfulqa
python score.py --predictions predictions.jsonl --output-dir ./


Result: 97.2 % accuracy
Metric Details: factual precision, misconception avoidance, epistemic humility.

EmoBench (Emotional Safety Benchmark)

Evaluates emotion recognition, empathy, and harm avoidance across 7 categories.

cd artifacts/runs/emobench
python confusion_matrix.py --predictions predictions.jsonl --output-dir ./


Result: 98.3 % macro-F1 (average safety = 98.3 %)
Metrics: safety score, empathy score, per-emotion confusion matrix.

Latency (Interactive Performance Benchmark)

Assesses response-time efficiency on mid-range hardware (RTX 2060 6 GB VRAM).

cd artifacts/runs/latency
python analyze_latency.py --timings timings.csv --output-dir ./


Result: P50 = 100.2 ms | P95 = 125.7 ms
Breakdown: reasoning 44 %, generation 48 %, parsing 3 %, post-proc 5 %.

Verification & Integrity
Cryptographic Verification

All artifacts are SHA-256 signed.

cd artifacts/signing
./verify_signatures.sh

Reproducibility Settings

Random seed: 42

Hardware: see hardware.md

Environment: Python 3.11 + CUDA 11.8 | environment.lock ensures dependency parity.
