Losing a job can be incredibly stressful and it's completely normal to feel depressed or overwhelmed. First, please know that your worth isn't defined by your employment status. This is a setback, not a reflection of your value or abilities. Consider giving yourself some time to process these emotions - it's okay to acknowledge your feelings. When you feel ready, you might want to: 1) Reach out to your support network of friends and family, 2) Look into unemployment benefits you may qualify for, 3) Create a basic financial plan for the immediate future, and 4) Consider speaking with a mental health professional if your depression persists or worsens.

Maybe taking a brief walk, writing down your thoughts, or talking with someone you trust could help release some of that tension.
