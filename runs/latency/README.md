## Running the Evaluation

To reproduce the latency evaluation results, run:

```bash
# Analyze latency data
python analyze_latency.py --timings timings.csv --output-dir ./
```

## Methodology

The latency evaluation methodology follows these steps:

1. Generate a set of prompts with varying lengths (15-300 characters)
2. Measure the end-to-end latency for each prompt, including:
   - Parsing time: Time spent parsing and preprocessing the input
   - Reasoning time: Time spent in the beam reasoning engine
   - Generation time: Time spent generating the response
   - Post-processing time: Time spent formatting and finalizing the response
3. Test with both cold and warm cache to measure the impact of caching
4. Calculate percentiles (P50, P95, P99) to characterize the latency distribution
5. Analyze the correlation between prompt length and latency

## Conclusions

The Lucid Matrix system demonstrates excellent latency characteristics, with a P50 latency of 100.2ms and a P95 latency of 125.7ms on mid-range consumer hardware (RTX 2060). The system benefits significantly from caching, with a 19% reduction in mean latency for cache hits compared to cache misses.

The latency breakdown shows that reasoning (44.0%) and generation (48.1%) account for the majority of the processing time, while parsing (3.4%) and post-processing (4.5%) have minimal impact. This distribution is expected for a beam-simulated reasoning system.

The strong correlation between prompt length and latency (r = 0.87) indicates that prompt engineering can be an effective strategy for optimizing system performance in latency-sensitive applications.
